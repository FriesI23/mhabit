## [2024-10-10] meet "source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release" on building apk

If you see the messages below while building your Android app,
itâ€™s because `Android Studio Ladybug` upgrade has updated the JDK version to 21.

```log
warning: [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
warning: [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
warning: [options] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.
```

These warnings are harmless; you can choose to ignore them or simply use JDK 17 instead of 21.

```shell
# macos arm64
brew install openjdk@17
flutter config --jdk-dir /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
```
