## FAQ

### Can't Install Windows App via MSIX Installer, show signature error

On a first-time attempt to install this MSIX, following prompt may appear:

> This app packageâ€™s publisher certificate could not be verified.
> Contact your system administrator or the app developer to obtain
> a new app package with verified certificates.
> The root certificate and all immediate certificates of the signature
> in the app package must be verified (0x800B010A).

This is because the MSIX installation package provided in Github/Releases/Assets
is a self-signed version, corresponding certificate must be trusted
on each machine which attempt to install it.

Install the certificate by following theese steps:

> See [**"Installing a test certificate directly from an MSIX package"**][msix-install-cert]
> for steps with screenshots.

1. Right click msix installer package, select **Properties**
2. Switch to **Digital Signatures** tab and click signer under **Embedded Signatures**
3. Click **Details**, in new window click **View Certificate**
4. In new window (Certificate), click **Install Certificate**
5. In **Certificate Import Wizard** window:
   1. Select **Local Machine** and click **Next**
   2. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**
   3. Click **Browse** and select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
   4. Click **Finish**.
6. Finally a dialog with "_The import was successful._" should be poped-up.

Or execute commands below:

```powershell
# run at administrator
$signature = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "\path\to\your\mhabit.msix"
$certificate = $signature.SignerCertificate
Export-Certificate -Cert $certificate -FilePath ".\mhabit.crt"
Import-Certificate -FilePath ".\mhabit.crt" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

After operations above, this MSIX package should now be able to install successfully.

> Trusting self-signed certificate always carries some risks.
> Skipping signature verification to install via command below is also allowed:
>
> ```powershell
> Add-AppPackage -Path "\path\to\your\mhabit.msix" -AllowUnsigned
> ```
