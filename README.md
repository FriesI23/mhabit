> 1. Windows version is still in beta, some features may be limited or unstable.

### Note: Installation iOS (Sideloading)

1. Install [**AltStore**][altstore] / [**SideStore**][sidestore] follow official instructions.
2. Download `mhabit-unsigned.ipa` on your iOS device directly from the [latest releases][github-myapp].
3. Install this IPA file.

### Note: Windows MSIX Insaller

On a first-time attempt to install this MSIX, following prompt may appear:

> This app packageâ€™s publisher certificate could not be verified.
> Contact your system administrator or the app developer to obtain
> a new app package with verified certificates.
> The root certificate and all immediate certificates of the signature
> in the app package must be verified (0x800B010A)

This is because the MSIX installation package provided in Github/Releases/Assets
is a self-signed version, corresponding certificate must be trusted
on each machine which attempt to install it.

Install certificate by following the steps below:

> See [**here**][msix-install-cert] for steps with screenshots.

1. Right click msix installer package, select **Properties**
2. Switch to **Digital Signatures** tab and click signer under **Embedded Signatures**
3. Click **Details**, In new window click **View Certificate**
4. In new window (Certificate), click **Install Certificate**
5. In **Certificate Import Wizard** window:
   1. Select **Local Machine** and click **Next**
   2. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**
   3. Click **Browse** and select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
   4. Click **Finish**.
6. Finally a dialog with "_The import was successful._" should be poped-up.

Or execute commands below:

```powershell
# run at administrator
$signature = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "\path\to\your\mhabit.msix"
$certificate = $signature.SignerCertificate
Export-Certificate -Cert $certificate -FilePath ".\mhabit.crt"
Import-Certificate -FilePath ".\mhabit.crt" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

After operations above, this MSIX package should now be able to install successfully.

> Trusting self-signed certificate always carries some risks.
> Skipping signature verification to install via command below is also allowed:
>
> ```powershell
> Add-AppPackage -Path "\path\to\your\mhabit.msix" -AllowUnsigned
> ```

## Todo

| status      | progress                   | desc. |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----- |
| -           | Publish to Google Play     |       |

## Build from source

Make sure your flutter version same as `.flutter`, You can use `fvm`` to keep
multiple versions on your local machine, or simply use this submodule to build it!

1. in project folder, run `flutter pub get`
2. open an android or ios emulator
3. run `flutter run --debug`

### Building for iOS / macOS

iOS required flavor, use `flutter run --debug --flavor f_dev/f_generic` instead command above.

### Building for Linux

**requires:**

1. installing the following packages for the [SQFlite database][sqflite-ffi-linux]:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev
```

2. Ensure that all dependencies required by [`flutter_secure_storage`][fss-linux] are satisfied:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev libjsoncpp-dev
```

3. If an error occurs during the build process, please follow these
   [steps][flutter-linux] strictly.

## Configuring WebDAV Synchronization (Beta)

You will need a compatible server for it, e.g. Nextcloud, Koofr, etc. You will find some configuration examples below.

### Nextcloud Configuration
1. Create a dedicated app password in your Nextcloud:
   - Go to Profile â†’ Settings â†’ Security â†’ bottom of the page
   - Enter an app name (e.g., "mhabit" or "test") and confirm your password
   ![Create new app][nextcloud-test-app]
   - Save the generated password
   ![Retrieve app credentials][nextcloud-test-app-credentials]

2. Configure mhabit with your Nextcloud server:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Sync Options â†’ Sync Server â†’ Current: WebDAV
   - Enter your server URL (format: `https://example.com/remote.php/dav/files/[nextcloud user]`)
   ![Server configuration][nextcloud-test-app-server-config]

3. Perform initial sync:
   - Now return back to Settings
   - Click the refresh button next to `Sync Now`
   - Successful connection will display sync status
   ![First synchronization][nextcloud-test-app-first-sync]
   
4. Enjoy automatic sync:
   - Additional syncs will occur without other modals
   - Verify sync status by checking the last sync timestamp
   ![Success synchronizations][nextcloud-test-app-sync-success]
